# Next.js 15 App Router - next/Link Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered when using `next/link` within a component that's part of a layout in Next.js 15's App Router.

## Bug Description
The `next/link` component doesn't behave as expected when used within a component that is part of a layout.  The link may not work correctly or might produce unexpected routing behavior. This is likely due to how the App Router handles layouts and their interaction with client-side navigation.

## Setup and Reproduction
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the home page. Observe the `next/link` behavior.

## Potential Solutions
The solution might involve a deeper understanding of how the App Router handles layouts and navigation.  Alternative approaches could include using client-side routing libraries or exploring the use of `useRouter` hook for navigation control within the layout component.

## Additional Context
This bug highlights the potential challenges of using traditional Next.js routing components within the new App Router structure. Further investigation is needed to provide a robust and reliable solution.
